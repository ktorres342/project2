		<h1>Pixar Movies Within Same UNIVERSE?</h1>

		<h2>Where does it start?</h2>


		<p class="text"><strong>It all started with BRAVE (14th-15th century)</strong></p>
		<div class="grid">
				<img src="images/merida-wisps.jpg" class="left"/>
				<p class="text">The witch is the reason why there is magic, the will o’ wisps are the cause of the birth of humans with superpowers.</p>
	
			<p class="text"><strong>The Incredibles (1950-1960’s)</strong></p>
				<img src="images/incredibles-21.jpg" class="left" height="300px" width="600px" />
				<p class="text">Syndrome created artificial intelligence for robots and zero-point energy (unseen energy that is in the form of 
				which then was absorbed by inanimate objects, toys) tat the toys eventually absorbed the power through the wavelengths.</p>

			<p class="text"><strong>Toy story (1997-1998)</strong></p>
				<img src="images/toy-story-group.jpeg" class="left"/>
				<p class="text">With the toys coming to life due to the power Syndrome created, the toys decided to create rules/ laws that way they 
				can earn the humans love and thrive. But of course everything can't be sunshine and rainbows, so they understand what
				happens to a toy when separated from the humans.</p>

			<p class="text"><strong>Toy Story 2 (1999)</strong></p>
				<img src="images/Toy-Story-2.jpg" class="left"/>
				<p class="text">Being isolated from humans made the toys question their purpose without them. This then build sadness and soon resentment.
				For example, Jesse is still affected that her owner left her and will never see humans the same. This anger and resentment 
				towards humans wasn't only with the toys but animals too.</p>

			<p class="text"><strong>Finding Nemo (2003)</strong></p>
				<img src="images/find-nemo.jpeg" class="left"/>
				<p class="text">The sea life in this ocean is very advanced, their life consists of schools, a network, and a free way system. Now the fish 
				are aware of what humans are capable of, they pollute, capture and experiment on their own kind. That's why Marlin was so strict 
				about Nemo touching 'the butt' of the boat. With his long adventure to find his son, he ended up finding this curiosity with the humans.</p>

			<p class="text"><strong>Ratatouille (2007)</strong></p>
				<img src="images/ratatouille.jpeg" class="left"/>
				<p class="text">In this movie a rat discovers his love for cooking inside of the kitchen and goes through a whole journey of controlling a chef who can't cook, 
				to fearing them.</p>

			<p class="text"><strong>Toy Story 3 (2010)</strong></p>
				<img src="images/toy-story-3.jpg" class="left"/>
				<p class="text">After three years, toys have been through a lot regarding humans. It's been shown that they have been physically and emotionally abused by the owners.
				Lotso the Huggin' Bear (the antagonist) carries the burning hate for humans because of they way they use and dispose of toys like they are worthless. 
				With the heat between the toys and the humans rising, there is proof Carl and Ellie had informed Andy about what has been going on. They even offered
				him a ride to paradise falls to escape the future of the hatred rising too far. That’s why Carl and Ellie decided it was best to live alone, in solitude.</p>

			<p class="text"><strong>Up (2011-2016)</strong></p>
				<img src="images/up.png" class="left"/>
				<p class="text">After Ellie died, BnL expanded and told him he was going to have to give his house up to the company. This was only foreshadowing that fact how BnL 
				was going to pollute the earth pretty badly. Then Carl takes off with his house and the balloons to find out the animals on the land of paradise falls can talk. Little 
				did he know that he would meet his childhood hero in that place to see he trained an army of dogs, causing a war between humans and animals. Who do you think won that war?</p>

			<p class="text"><strong>Cars (2100-2200)</strong></p>
				<img src="images/cars.jpg" class="left"/>
				<p class="text">The machines ended up helping the humans beat the animals but this only continued the awful contamination of pollution in the air. That’s why in cars you 
				see no people, because the company AXIOM built a space ship to transfer every human to space until earth is clean.</p>

			<p class="text"><strong>Cars 2 (2100-2200)</strong></p>
				<img src="images/Cars-2.jpg" class="left"/>
				<p class="text">With the humans being gone for so long, it gave the machines a chance to build a life, make friends, and compete in races around the world. But unfortunately with cars
				needing oil to run, the company Allinol had to create green energy in order to stop using other sources. And secretly, Allinol was being run and owned by the one and only 
				company BnL. This ended up polluting the entire earth so horribly that it was no longer fit to hold any kind of life. Not even machine life.</p>

			<p class="text"><strong>Wall-E (2800-2900)</strong></p>
				<img src="images/walle.jpg" class="left"/>
				<p class="text">Due to the expansion of BnL, it has made earth inhabitable for thousands of years. Now when the machines had to take over, only they could survive for so long. 
				Eventually the machines started to die off, leaving Wall-E to be the only one left. The reason for his survival was because he personally was fascinated by the humans and even kept 
				a friend in the form of a cockroach. Over time it is showed that the humans actually depend on robots and this is presented in having Wall-E represent 'Jesus' and the female robot 
				of the story being called 'Eve'. The old shoe holding the baby plant came from Wall-E, presenting itself in the form of Jesus starting a new life on Earth for the humans. In the credits
				of the movie, there is a clip where the shoe is placed deep into the ground and out grows a mighty tree. The tree that takes place in Bug's Life some might even say.</p>
		
			<p class="text"><strong>A Bug's Life (2898-3000)</strong></p>
				<img src="images/bugslife.jpg" class="left"/>
				<p class="text">The ants in A Bug's Life inhabit the tree Wall-E grew. Usually ants only live up to three months, but as time goes on the ants are evolving and their genes are being 
				mutated. Now when Flik decides he wants to take a journey people from his home warn him about snakes, birds, and bigger bugs that are potential threats, but the one thing they don't 
				talk about is humans. With humans not being a threat to the ant kind, it has given them the opportunity build a life and invent things to make their little lives easier. This is proof
				that the animal species is only evolving and soon to become more dominant.</p>
		
			<p class="text"><strong>Monsters University (4500-5000)</strong></p>
				<img src="images/monsters-university.jpg" class="left"/>
				<p class="text">Once again, due to the pollution and radiation the big company BnL is producing, it caused the animals to evolve into monsters. This is entirely just wiping out the 
				human race and decided to create their own way of life. So why not build a school! Monsters University was originally founded in 1313, you can't find this date on the human calendar,
				and because the humans were wiped out the monsters were raised and taught that humans are awful and extremely toxic to their kind. This put them in the mind set that humans weren't 
				needed and could be easily disposed of.</p>

			<p class="text"><strong>Monsters Inc. (4500-5000)</strong></p>
				<img src="images/monsters-inc.jpg" class="left"/>
				<p class="text">Little did they know that humans are actually a necessity to be able to run their own community. But they realized this all too late, so they had to figure out how 
				they were going to get their energy from the source. That's when the monsters created machines and doors to travel BACK in time where humans still roamed the earth. This now circles 
				us all the way back to the one and only... Boo.</p>
