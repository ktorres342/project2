				<p>Could the movie 'Up' be about the journey of Carl making his way into the afterlife? 
				The theory is... throughout the trip to paradise falls he was dead. It is believed 
				that after he was told it was time to go into a retirement home, he died THAT night 
				in his sleep. Now how could the journey to Paradise Falls be considered the trip to the afterlife.
				Let's start from the beginning, who is that boy scout that shows up at his door step? Russell, is 
				considered his guardian angel who is trying to ear his wings, final badge. The reason why his 
				guardian angel took the form of a young boy is because for the longest time, Carl and Ellie had 
				been trying to have a baby but unfortunately was not able to. So why not have your guardian be a kid!
				Of course Carl isn't aware that he is dead, so the first stepping stone into traveling into
				this afterlife was that storm. That storm is believed to have Carl detach himself to the things that 
				directly tie him to Earth, he needs to move on. You see throughout the movie's plot tests Carl and his
				belongings, trying to get him to let go but of course he always has a problem with it as he tries to 
				fight to keep everything with him. This continues on and on until the end, when he has to physically 
				has to let go of the house, concluding the moving on process. As if this movie wasn't sad enough...</p>

				<p>How could Brave (taken place in the dark ages of Scotland) and Monsters Inc. (taking place long into 
				the future) be connected? It is believed that the witch from Brave is Boo from Monsters Inc who went back 
				in time in search for her dear friend Sully. It all started when Sully took Boo back to her room and left 
				her world, that she was never able to let go of her best friend. So for the longest time, she has been
				attempting to master jumping between eras but suddenly and unfortunately got stuck in Scotland. But she
				has succeeded on a certain level because in the movie Brave, there was a moment where the witch disappeared 
				through a door. This shows she already has a good understanding of how to manipulate the power of the doors 
				just like in Monsters Inc. Another clue that the creators gave us was the scene when camera shot goes 
				around the witches cottage you can spot a carving of no other but... SULLY! Then in Monsters University 
				there is the number A113, and you can spot the same letter and number right above the door to the witch's cottage.
				(Although the numbers are in roman numerals) All Boo wanted was her friend back...</p>

				<p>Her home is very closely built like a villain's lair and when the house's security thought Elastic Girl was
				uninvited, the gun was ready to blast her. She even had the accessibility to flamethrowers, machine guns, grenades 
				and more to test out her suits. Then while watching the testing she looks rather entertained to see all the explosions. 
				And no matter the superhero she wasn’t afraid or scared to stand her ground and force them to do her will considering 
				these superheroes would be able to crush her in a matter of seconds. At the gates of her house (or you might even say LAIR) 
				are guards and she treats them rather mean, showing she personally doesn’t like them. You could arguably say they are 
				there to make sure she doesn’t create technology that would help advance other villains and take out the world. Think 
				about it, why would a suit designer for good superheroes need guarding? Doesn’t make sense right. Being a former villain 
				doesn’t mean you can’t still think like one. Jack-Jack’s parents didn’t even know he was going to have powers and somehow
				Edna knew. So she created a suit for him that can withstand anything, since she wasn’t sure what powers he was going to 
				obtain YET. AND she knew a villain was going to go after him eventually, the one and only, Syndrome. Now Edna is absolutely 
				AGAINST any superheroes wearing capes, due to the past deaths her suits with capes caused. So how is it that out of all the
				superheroes and villains, Syndrome is the only one who has a cape? Mr. INcredibles used to be the hero to Syndrome until he
				crushed those dreams with the tip of his finger. What would stop syndrome from getting his suit created by the one and only 
				Edna? She created Mr. Incredible, why cant she create his. Now her being a former villain, she sure can spot one and think 
				like one. She knew that Syndrome wasn’t meant for good, he was meant for the bad and ended up designing his suit with… a cape.
				Which was the reason for resulting in his death: cape getting sucked into a propeller.</p>
