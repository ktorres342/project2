		<h1>How was Pixar Created?</h1>
		<div class="grid">
			<p class="storytext">Pixar was created in 1979 by a man named George Lucas and he recruited 
			another man name Ed Catmull from the New York Institute of technology. Then 
			in 1986, Steve Jobs bought the Computer Division from George and it was named Pixar.
			Only 40 people were employed with the company at the time. They later got a sign 
			off to create their first short film, Luxo Jr.. It was known as the first three dimensional 
			computer animated film, it was even nominated for the Best Short Film (Animated). 1995 rolled around and the world's FIRST computer animated feature film 
			was released on the big screen on November 22nd. It was ranked #1 the first week it came out and ended up making $362
			million worldwide. When 1997 arrived, they made an announcement where they agreed to make 
			five movies over the course of ten years. After making a few very successful movies and short
			films, the company Pixar had the opportunity to move into a new building in Emeryville, California
			in 2000. Then from 2001 - 2012, they created and released their best movies yet, the most famous 
			and popular ones.</p>
